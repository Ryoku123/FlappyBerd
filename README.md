Hello, I made Flappy Berd in pyqt

I know the code is not good and all over the place :)) still a beginner

While there is an available .exe file for download, I generally advise against downloading executable files from the internet, including mine. Therefore, I highly recommend downloading the source code instead. However, if you're still inclined to proceed, you can access the .exe file [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/kxp380ila68on2m/flappy.exe/file). Please note that it's hosted on MediaFire due to its size exceeding 25MB (it's 36MB).
